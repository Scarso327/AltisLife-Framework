<b>Mantle Network</b> is an online community built entirely upon the needs of our player base and associated partners. Operating as the public image of our subsidiary, North London RPC, we aim to build bridges between groups who would usually remain apart. As a constantly growing collective, we are constantly forming networks with our partners and like-minded player bases, creating a well-informed and relevant Network that is ready to meet the demands of people all who join. Backed by competent development and administration teams, we only move forward in supplying high-quality and reliable services for our members to enjoy across all platforms.

# Mutli Server Support

Currently, the framework isn't suitable for running multiple servers as certain features don't work and would introduce exploits/inconsistency. Below we've listed the features that would need work/considerations to support multiple servers. Future work will be completed to allow for this.

  - <b>Housing</b>
    - When houses are bought/sold they'll only be set up for one server but exist in the same table allowing conflicts.
